When sending out basic authentication, you can use the HTTPBasicAuth module from requests.auth 
You send it somewhat like this

r = requests.get(url,auth=HTTPBasicAuth('user','pass'))
where user --> Username
and passs --> Password

This will then come appended as a Header llike this
{'Authorization': 'Basic a2V5OnBsZWFzZQ=='}

After Basic is the base64 encoded version of user:pass
