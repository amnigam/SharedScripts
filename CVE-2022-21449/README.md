# CVE-2022-214449 Vulnerable ECDSA JWT library in Java 17 & 18

This script is inspired from Pentesterlab exercise on CVE-2022-21449 

CVE-2022-21449 allows a malicious actor to bypass authentication by providing a "null" signature or an ECDSA signature whose parameters r & s are equal to 0. 
If an attacker can create a signature with r & s set to 0, whatever is in the payload portion of the JWT will be considered as valid. 

This can result in an attacker elevating their privileges on an application from a standard user to admin or some other critical user.
This script creates such a signature and additionally it concatenates this signature to the custom attack payload inside JWT. The payload can be provided in plain text.

Script will generate the Payload & Signature portions of the JWT.
