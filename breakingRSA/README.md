### Breaking RSA Algorithm. 

## TLDR 
RSA algorithm is susceptible to compromise in case if the prime numbers chosen in developing the keys happen to be not sufficiently spaced apart. 
In such a situation, by leveraging Fermat's factorization method, one can arrive at the prime numbers initially chosen for the development of public & private keys.

In the context of RSA algorithm, this is catastrophic as it would lead to a complete compromise of the public & private keys.
